# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

# Scripts

To get the front end up and running allocate yourself in the root folder of the project:  
```
~$ cd "Your_Path_To_Evicertia_FrontEnd_Folder"
```

Install dependencies
```
~$ npm install
```

Launch the app:
```
~$ npm run dev
```

There are minimal changes done to the  backend repo. You can check those out in the diary.

You can use nvm to match node version in .nvmrc file
